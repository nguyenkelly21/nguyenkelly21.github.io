### CPSC 120
 
* Lab 4
 
   I really enjoyed working on lab 4, part 1 because it was the first lab where we were able to put an input and calculate an output based on it. In the lab, we were asked to find the date difference and it was cool seeing how you could put a function in and make it compute an answer. I liked how quickly it solved the math because finding the date between two different dates would take a lot of time by hand, but with this lab, we were able to quicken the process.
 
* Lab 6
 
    Lab 6, part 2 is another lab that I liked programming because it showed the user if their guess was getting closer or farther away from the correct answer. I learned a lot about loops in this lab since we were required to give users multiple tries if they guessed wrong. I also liked how users were able to reply with a yes or no answer when asked if they wanted to play the game again and it would restart over again.
 
* Lab 8
 
    Out of all the labs, lab 8, part 3 is my favorite because I never knew you could compute an image from code. It was really cool seeing how the animation file was read and played out to create a beautiful image. I liked how it gave the option to control the speed of how fast the animation would play out and how we could make sure it ran smoothly.
